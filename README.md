# Customer Profiling Using Computer Vision
In an increasingly interconnected world, where businesses strive to deliver personalized and relevant experiences, the fusion of cutting-edge technology with customer understanding has never been more crucial. 

Customer profiling through computer vision offers a multitude of benefits that ripple across diverse sectors. By accurately determining age and gender, businesses can refine their marketing strategies, ensuring messages resonate with the intended audience. Furthermore, gauging customer emotions provides invaluable insights into product satisfaction and service quality, allowing companies to swiftly address concerns and optimize user experiences.

In this Project, we use Convolutional Neural Network-based Deep Learning for model training. We train three separate models each for Age, Gender, and Emotion and finally integrate all three to predict the final prediction combining all three models.
